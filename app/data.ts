<p>
  I‚Äôm a developer with a focus on <strong>AI-enhanced coding and automation</strong>. I build <strong>AI-driven workflows, automated systems, and intelligent web applications</strong> to make work more efficient.
</p>
<p>
  With a strong background in full-stack development, I now integrate AI and automation into my projects, using tools like <strong>n8n, OpenAI, Zapier, LangChain, Notion and Supabase</strong>. My approach blends traditional coding with smart automation to streamline processes and enhance productivity.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond building, I also <strong>help developers transition into AI-powered development and assist individuals in automating their content creation workflows</strong>. If you're looking to integrate AI into your work but don‚Äôt know where to start, I can guide you.
</p>
<p>
  Right now, I‚Äôm focused on expanding my AI automation expertise and helping others do the same. In the future, I plan to develop <strong>scalable AI-driven products</strong>‚Äîbut for now, it‚Äôs all about building, automating, and sharing knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Let‚Äôs connect and explore AI together!</strong>
